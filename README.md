Y-Designs, Inc WordPress Scripts

These scripts are for setting up [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) on VVV.  It works in conjunction with the VV scripts.  Its just mostly an amalgamation of things that we need to get our work done.
Here's a link to our docs/tutorial on how you might use this with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) and [VV](https://github.com/bradp/vv): [YD_WP tutorial](http://y-designs.com/blog/wordpress-development-consistency-and-deployments/)
